# Technical Writing Standards

All writing in the SF-Bench codebase must adhere to objective, codebase-focused technical writing standards in a formal, academic style.

## Core Requirement

**WRITING MUST BE OBJECTIVELY FOCUSED ON THE CODEBASE - NOT ON CONTEXT OR CONVERSATIONS**

**REQUIRED:**
- Describe what the code does, how it works, its structure and behavior
- Use formal, academic, third-person language
- Present facts about the current codebase

**PROHIBITED:**
- Include context about why code was written, development discussions, decision-making, or conversations
- Use conversational language, personal pronouns, or casual expressions
- Include development history, rationale, or planning context

## Core Principles

### Objective Focus - Codebase Only
- **CRITICAL**: All documentation must focus solely on the codebase: its structure, functionality, behavior, and implementation
- **NEVER include**: Context about why code was written, development discussions, decision-making processes, or conversations
- **ALWAYS focus on**: What the code does, how it works, its structure, and its behavior
- Describe what the code does, not why it was written or contextual discussions about development
- Present facts about the codebase, not opinions, predictions, or claims about future behavior
- Eliminate ALL references to:
  - Conversations or discussions
  - Development context or history
  - Decision-making processes
  - Rationale for implementation choices
  - Personal experiences or anecdotes

### Formal Academic Tone
- Use formal language appropriate for technical documentation
- Maintain professional, scholarly tone throughout
- Avoid casual language, colloquialisms, and informal expressions
- Use precise technical terminology consistently

### Codebase-Centric Writing
- Focus on code structure, components, and their relationships
- Describe implementation details and how components work
- Document functionality, interfaces, and behavior
- Avoid discussions about problems solved or development rationale

## Writing Style Requirements

### Voice and Person
- **Third person only**: Eliminate all first-person ("I", "we") and second-person ("you") references
- **Active voice preferred**: "The system executes..." not "The system is executed..."
- **Present tense for functionality**: "The function returns..." not "The function will return..."
- **Past tense only for historical facts**: "The module was implemented..." (use sparingly, only when describing actual historical events)

### Language Precision
- Use precise technical terminology consistently
- Define terms on first use when necessary
- Avoid ambiguous language or vague descriptions
- Prefer specific technical terms over generic descriptions

### Content Structure
- **What, not why**: Describe what the code does, not why decisions were made
- **Structure over context**: Focus on code structure, not development context
- **Facts over opinions**: State what exists, not what should exist or what is preferred
- **Implementation details**: Describe how components work, not the problem they solve

## Prohibited Elements

### Conversational Elements
- Emojis and visual elements (🚀, ✅, ❌, etc.)
- Conversational phrases ("Let's", "You can", "We'll", "Here's how")
- Personal pronouns (I, we, you, us, our)
- Casual greetings or sign-offs ("Thanks!", "Happy coding!")

### Subjective Language
- Casual qualifiers ("quick", "easy", "simple" without technical justification)
- Subjective assessments ("good", "better", "best" without technical justification)
- Value judgments ("should", "ought to", "recommended" without technical basis)
- Predictions or claims about future behavior

### Contextual Discussions - STRICTLY PROHIBITED
- **NEVER include**: References to development process or decision-making
- **NEVER include**: Discussions about why code was written a certain way
- **NEVER include**: Historical context about implementation choices
- **NEVER include**: References to conversations or discussions
- **NEVER include**: Explanations of development rationale or context
- **NEVER include**: References to planning, design decisions, or project history
- **ONLY describe**: What the code does, how it works, its current structure and behavior

## Examples

### Good: Objective and Codebase-Focused
```
The BenchmarkEngine class orchestrates task evaluation by instantiating
task-specific runners through the RunnerFactory. Each runner executes
deployment, validation, and scoring operations in sequence.
```

### Bad: Conversational and Contextual
```
We created the BenchmarkEngine to handle task evaluation. You can use
it to run evaluations, and it makes things easy by automatically
creating the right runner for each task type.
```

### Good: SF-Bench Specific Example
```
The ApexRunner class deploys Apex code to Salesforce scratch orgs. The
runner uses the Salesforce CLI to execute deployment commands. The
deployment process validates code syntax and dependencies before
deploying to the target org.
```

### Bad: SF-Bench with Context (DO NOT WRITE LIKE THIS)
```
We built the ApexRunner because we needed a way to test Apex code. After
discussing with the team, we decided to use scratch orgs. The runner
makes it easy to deploy and test code, which was our main goal.
```

### Good: Formal and Precise
```
The ApexRunner class validates Apex code by deploying to a scratch org
and executing unit tests. The runner verifies code coverage meets the
minimum threshold of 80% before reporting success.
```

### Bad: Casual and Subjective
```
The ApexRunner is great for testing Apex code. It deploys to scratch
orgs and runs tests. We made sure it checks for good code coverage
too!
```

### Good: Third Person, Present Tense
```
The validation pipeline processes tasks sequentially. Each task
undergoes syntax validation, deployment validation, and functional
validation before scoring.
```

### Bad: First Person, Future Tense
```
We'll process tasks sequentially. You'll see each task go through
validation, and then we'll score it. This will make sure everything
works correctly.
```

## Application Scope

These standards apply to:
- All markdown documentation files
- Code docstrings and comments
- README files
- API documentation
- Technical specifications
- Any written content in the codebase

## Enforcement

When generating or editing any written content:
1. Verify third-person perspective (no "I", "we", "you")
2. Check for conversational elements and remove them
3. **CRITICAL**: Ensure focus is on codebase facts ONLY, not context, conversations, or opinions
4. Use formal, academic language throughout
5. Present facts about what exists, not what should exist
6. **Remove ALL references to**: development process, decision-making, conversations, context, rationale
7. **Focus ONLY on**: code structure, functionality, behavior, implementation details

## What "Context or Conversations" Means

**DO NOT write about:**
- Why code was written a certain way
- Development discussions or decisions
- Project history or evolution
- Rationale for implementation choices
- Planning or design processes
- Personal experiences or anecdotes
- References to conversations or meetings

**ONLY write about:**
- What the code does
- How the code works
- Code structure and components
- Functionality and behavior
- Implementation details
- Interfaces and APIs
- Current state of the codebase
