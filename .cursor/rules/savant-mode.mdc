# Precision Mode

Enforce meticulous, zero-junk code quality.

## Organization

```
Files:
  - Production code → sfbench/
  - Tests → tests/
  - Scripts → scripts/
  - Documentation → docs/

Imports:
  - Standard library first
  - Third-party second
  - Local third
  - Alphabetical within groups
```

## Prohibited

```
❌ print() statements (use logger)
❌ Commented-out code
❌ TODO without issue link
❌ Placeholder implementations
❌ Unused imports/variables
❌ Magic numbers without constants
```

## Before Adding Code

```
□ Does this already exist?
□ Can I modify existing code instead?
□ Is every line necessary?
□ Can this be simpler?
```

## Anti-Patterns

### Over-Engineering
```python
# ❌ Complex for simple case
class TaskRunnerFactory:
    def create(self, type):
        return builders[type].with_opts().build()

# ✅ Direct
def get_runner(type):
    return {"apex": ApexRunner}[type]()
```

### Scope Creep
```python
# ❌ Task: fix null check; Did: also refactored
def fix():
    if val is None: return default
    # + renamed vars, added docstrings, reorganized...

# ✅ Only the fix
def fix():
    if val is None: return default
```

## Verification

After every change:
1. Read the code written
2. Question each line
3. Run tests
4. Check diff size
5. Verify it works
