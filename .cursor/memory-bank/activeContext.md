# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

AI-native infrastructure operational. Ready for development.

## Recent Changes

- [2026-01-27] Removed conversational analogies from AGENTS.md (Sheldon Cooper, kernel references)
- [2026-01-27] AGENTS.md now purely professional and technical
- [2026-01-27] Pre-commit hooks installed and tested
- [2026-01-27] Verification hook refined (fixed false positive profanity detection)
- [2026-01-27] Secrets baseline created for documentation false positives

## Next Steps

1. Address flake8 lint issues in codebase (existing code quality debt)
2. Continue standard development with verification protocols active

## Active Decisions

- AGENTS.md uses 🔒/📖 markers for behavioral vs reference content
- Verification hook runs on session stop
- Pre-commit hooks active for formatting and security

## Blockers

- None
