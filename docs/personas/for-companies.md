# SF-Bench for Companies

**Evaluate AI coding tools objectively. Make data-driven decisions based on actual performance metrics.**

---

## 🎯 Why Companies Need SF-Bench

### The Problem

Companies investing in AI coding tools face uncertainty:

- ❓ **Which AI tool should we use for Salesforce?**
- ❓ **What's the ROI?**
- ❓ **Will it work for our use cases?**
- ❓ **How do we compare options?**

### The Solution

**SF-Bench provides objective, data-driven answers:**

- ✅ **Objective comparison** of AI models
- ✅ **Real-world performance** metrics
- ✅ **Salesforce-specific** evaluation
- ✅ **Transparent methodology**

---

## 💼 Business Case

### The Opportunity

**Salesforce development is expensive:**
- Senior Salesforce developers: $120K-$180K/year
- Development time: Weeks to months per project
- Maintenance costs: Ongoing

**AI coding assistants can:**
- ⚡ **Accelerate development** by 30-50%
- 💰 **Reduce costs** by automating routine tasks
- 🎯 **Improve quality** with consistent patterns
- 📈 **Scale team** productivity

### The Challenge

**Not all AI tools are equal:**
- Some work great for Python, but fail on Salesforce
- Generic benchmarks don't reflect Salesforce reality
- No objective way to compare options

**SF-Bench solves this** by providing Salesforce-specific evaluation.
